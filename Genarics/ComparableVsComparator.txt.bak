TreeSet t = new TreeSet();
			|--> interally calls public TreeSet(); Constructor

--> the public TreeSet(); constructor internally calls comparable interface methods to sort the objects
    Based on the default sorting order 

What is the comparable interface
================================
	this is a functional interface prensent inside the java.lang. package
	This is interface is internally used by TreeSet Objects during the sorting processof the objects

	@FunctionalInterface
	public interface java.lang.Comparable<T>{

		public abstract int compareTo(T);

	}

	Example1: Refere CVC1.java
NOTE:
====
	When you work with TreeSet the data Should be homegeneous other wise you will get ClassCastException
