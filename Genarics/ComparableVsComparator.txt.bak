TreeSet t = new TreeSet();
			|--> interally calls public TreeSet(); Constructor

--> the public TreeSet(); constructor internally calls comparable interface methods to sort the objects
    Based on the default sorting order 

What is the comparable interface
================================
	this is a functional interface prensent inside the java.lang. package
	This is interface is internally used by TreeSet Objects during the sorting processof the objects

	@FunctionalInterface
	public interface java.lang.Comparable<T>{

		public abstract int compareTo(T);

	}

	Example1: Refere CVC1.java
NOTE:
====
	to keep the data inside the TreeSet we should make sure that our data
		a. is homogenous bcz it uses the comparTo method of the Comparable interface to sort the Objects
		b. the Object compulsurly implement the Interface Called Comparable otherwise ClassCastException
			Examples: refere CVC2.java

Note:
====	
	all the Wrapper Classes and String Class implements the Comparable interface and from jdk 11 onwords StringBuffer also started Implementing Comparable interface


Comparable(I)
=============
	--it contains only abstract method that is compareTo()
		internal logic of the compareTo() method 
		obj1.compareTo(Obj2);
			--> returns -ve if and only if the obj1 has to come left to the obj2
			--> returns +vs if and only if the obj1 has to come right to the obj2
			--> returns 0 if both are same objects
			Example refer: CVC3.java
	--> When ever we depend on the default sorting nature of the TreeSet, internally the jvm will call the 
	    compareTo() method of the comparable and default aschending sorting will happen
		Example refer: CVC3.java
	NOTE: For String and Number Default sorting order will be ascending order
